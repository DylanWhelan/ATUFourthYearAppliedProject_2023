\chapter{Abstract}
SlimeWorld is a Unity-based game which simulates the evolution of slime creatures in a 3d environment. The slimes have traits such as scale and speed and are controlled using neural networks. In an attempt to properly  model evolution slimes inherit their traits and neural networks from their parents, with mutations made that are completely random and are not biased in any way by a slimes efficiency or inefficiency in its environmental niche, the guiding goal is that if a creature is most well suited to its niche, it will be the most successful at reproducing and hence it's children due to the inherited traits should have similar levels of success.
