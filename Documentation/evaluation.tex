\section{Creating a 2d Plane for Simulated Life}
This was the easiest of the goals that I set out to do with my project and though it is an environment free of flair or any complexity I do feel that the project has succeeded in creating a simple environment which contains simulated life.
\section{Populating the Plane with creatures}
I feel that though life in the context of the simulation is rather simple, I do think that it satisfies my initial goals as life is capable of evolution albeit in a simple manner and only governing a few traits, and I am happy with the fact the creatures can both eat, starve and be eaten. I am also happy with the manner in which the creatures can reproduce and the fact that many of a parent's traits are successfully passed down to their offspring which small changes occurring as required to manifest evolution.
\section{To include a System for Creatures to Evolve}
I feel that this is an area where I had fallen short of my desired goals as I had originally wished to implement a greater variety of inheritable traits that could affect the creature's lifestyles and had hoped to do this through a more complicated system based on specific genes that might be passed down, though I thought this, in the end, unnecessary as it was excessive to model in a simulation with asexual rather than sexual reproduction.
\section{To have Creatures controlled by a Neural Network}
I feel that this was the greatest failure of the project as I feel that my approach of using a small feed-forward neural network didn't provide enough potential for the creatures to learn to display intelligent behaviour in regards to trying to stay alive and that the lack of a specialized training method due to the desire to avoid any inherent motivations in the system meant that the neural network would either train far too slowly or always overshoot the "optimal" weights and biases for its purposes.
\section{To support multiple "species" of Creatures, suited to different niches}
I feel that my project failed in reaching this goal due to shortcomings of the neural network and the shallowness of the traits I implemented which meant that there wasn't enough depth in the simulation for any sort of ecological niches to form, and to be filled, furthermore, I couldn't develop an algorithm which would be able to define species in the context of the simulation.
\section{To create a Tweakable Environment}
Though I pursued it in a simple manner I am happy with the fact that many of the aspects of the simulation can be modified by changing the settings of the simulation, leading me to believe that the environment is at least somewhat tweakable.
